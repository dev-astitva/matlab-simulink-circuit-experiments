# Simple Electrical Circuit Simulations in MATLAB Simulink

This project shows two basic electrical circuits created using MATLAB Simulink.  
Each circuit has a diagram (image) and the output it produces.

## Circuits Included

1. **Battery & Resistances DC Circuit**  
   This circuit uses:
   - Battery (DC source)  
   - Three resistors (R1, R2, R3)  
   - Ammeter and voltmeter  
   - Scope for output  

   It shows current flow and voltage in a simple resistor network.

2. **RLC AC Circuit**  
   This circuit uses:
   - AC source  
   - Capacitor  
   - Inductor  
   - Resistor  
   - Meters (voltmeter, ammeter)  
   - Scope for output  

   It shows how voltage and current change across each component when AC power is given.

## What You Get

- Simulink files for each circuit  
- Images of each circuit diagram  
- Output screenshots showing voltages and currents  

## How to Use

1. Download the files from this repo.
2. Open the Simulink files (`.slx`) in MATLAB Simulink.
3. Run the simulation.
4. View the results on the scope and compare them with the output images.

## Requirements

- MATLAB and Simulink installed on your computer

## Output and Results

Screenshots of the circuit outputs are provided.  
They show voltages, currents, and waveforms from the scope block.

## Notes

- You can change component values and see new results.
- The circuits are for basic learning and demonstration.
